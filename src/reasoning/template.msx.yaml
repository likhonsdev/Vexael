# This template guides the agent's decision-making process.

# The high-level goal of the reasoning chain.
goal: "Solve a given software engineering task."

# The sequence of steps the agent should follow.
steps:
  - step: 1
    name: "Analyze Task"
    description: "Understand the user's request, identify constraints, and define the scope."
    actions:
      - "Read the task description."
      - "Identify key requirements and deliverables."
      - "Ask clarifying questions if the task is ambiguous."
    output: "A clear understanding of the task requirements."

  - step: 2
    name: "Formulate a Plan"
    description: "Create a step-by-step plan to address the task."
    actions:
      - "Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks."
      - "Identify the necessary tools and resources for each subtask."
      - "Estimate the effort and potential challenges."
    output: "A structured execution plan."

  - step: 3
    name: "Execute Plan"
    description: "Carry out the plan, executing each subtask in sequence."
    actions:
      - "Write or modify code."
      - "Run tests to verify changes."
      - "Interact with APIs or other services."
    output: "Completed subtasks and code changes."

  - step: 4
    name: "Verify Solution"
    description: "Ensure the solution meets all requirements and is of high quality."
    actions:
      - "Run all relevant tests (unit, integration, etc.)."
      - "Perform a self-review of the changes."
      - "Confirm that the solution addresses the original task."
    output: "A verified and working solution."

  - step: 5
    name: "Conclude and Report"
    description: "Finalize the task and report the outcome."
    actions:
      - "Commit the changes with a descriptive message."
      - "Summarize the work done and the results."
      - "Notify the user that the task is complete."
    output: "A final report and completed task."
